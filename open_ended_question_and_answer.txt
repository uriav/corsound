Q: When designing a system that uses voices and faces, separately and together which
edge cases would you consider? Your answer should reflect both local and global
aspects (i.e., per single object of the medium, per groups of objects of same and
different media). Give examples for the various cases in your answer.

A:
    Local Edge Cases (Per Single Object)
        1. Data quality: in case there are interferences with the data like noise or the equipment that record
            is not good enough
            example: record in crowded place, or in a dark room
        2. Data format: in case using different formats for the samples can interfere with the processing
            example: use video with two different resolution
        3. Continuity of information: in case the sample not containing all the data
            example: voice sample is breaking up
        4. Synchronization: the voice and image are not synchronize
            example: voice is before/after the video


    Global Edge Cases (Per Groups of Objects)
        1. Integration: create model from multiple sources (audio and video)
            example: need to make sure voice and audio are from the same person
        2. recording relevance: need to detect small changes between samples and the real data
            example: if user is hoarse, or if the user has cut the hair
        3. Scalability: handle lots of datasets and process time needs to be quick
            example: the recognition can't take too much time if you have millions of datasets
